# Tic_Tac_Toe

A simple tic-tac-toe game done in Python. This project started as a simple command line game created for Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code course of Udemy, but after completing that quickly I wanted to expand it a bit to get more practice.

Goals for the project:

- Create a visual game with Pygame and implement the current logic.
-  Create a 'hard' single player mode that utilizes a minmax algorithm. Currently there is an 'easy' single player mode that randomly generates legal move, though it is very bad at winning. Hope to create a chess game soon, which is the main motivation for this project.
-  Learn about and create an automated testing module.
